# ONLINE-QUIZ-MASTER-GAME

Companies and education usually want to test a specific area of knowledge rather than general knowledge. 
 
In this way, quizzes are an engaging method for companies and schools to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.

▸ Typically, a quiz is a short test and doesn’t have as great an impact on grades as a test.
